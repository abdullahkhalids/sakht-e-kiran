Sakht-e-kiran is a set of procedures for determining coincidence rates for passive optical interferometry in terms of the immanats of the scattering matrix.

It was used to generate results published in 

Abdullah Khalid, Dylan Spivak, Barry C. Sanders, and Hubert de Guise. Permutational symmetries for coincidence rates in multimode multiphotonic interferometry. Phys. Rev. A, 97:063802, 2018.
